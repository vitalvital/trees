# Basic Definitions
## Balance Function

def Β: Ν -> Ν (any such function)

Classic balance function is σ(n) [sum of proper divisors of n], giving classical definitions of _abundant_, _deficient_
and _perfect_ numbers, etc. 
We will slightly generalize here by using generic Β instead of σ.
Considering this generalization any following definitions, while bearing familiar classical names,
will have meaning only with respect to a given balance function.
